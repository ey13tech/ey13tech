As a student in my final semester, I am on track to graduate with a Bachelor's of Science in Cybercriminology in May. With a deep-seated interest in technology and a commitment to tackling intricate problems, I am poised to contribute meaningfully to the field of cybersecurity.

## Objective

My journey in computer science has ignited a fervent passion for cybersecurity, propelling me towards a desire to transition into this dynamic field. I am particularly eager to pursue opportunities within a Security Operations Center (SOC), where I aim to leverage my skills and knowledge as a Tier 1 Analyst to contribute effectively to safeguarding digital assets and mitigating cyber threats.
